# Copilot (AI assistant)

The copilot is DentalPin's conversational assistant. Open it from any
screen with the floating button or `Cmd/Ctrl+K`; it also has its own
page at `/copilot` with the conversation history.

## What it's for

Ask in natural language for what you'd otherwise do across screens:

- **Patients** — search, summarize, create and update contact data.
- **Schedule** — see the day, find free slots, book, reschedule, change
  appointment status (confirmed, in treatment, completed, no-show) and
  cancel.
- **Recalls** — list this month's due or overdue recalls, log call
  attempts, snooze or complete recalls.
- **Budgets** — list by status, view detail and send them to the
  patient by email.
- **Payments & invoices** — record payments with their allocation,
  check a patient's payment history and view invoices (read only).
- **Reports** — collections, billing and scheduling summaries.

## Guided workflows (chips)

An empty conversation shows grouped suggestions. The first three chain
several steps:

- **Daily briefing** — today's appointments + overdue recalls +
  unanswered budgets in one summary.
- **Prepare a visit** — patient record, their appointment, recalls,
  open budgets and payment history on one screen.
- **Fill a gap** — after a cancellation it suggests patients from the
  recall list (urgent first), books the chosen one and logs the call
  attempt.

You only see chips for actions your role allows.

## Confirmations

Every action that modifies data (create, move, cancel, charge, send)
pauses and shows you a confirmation card before executing. Irreversible
actions (cancel appointment, send budget) are highlighted in red.

## Permissions

The copilot never sees or does anything your user couldn't do through
the UI. Module permissions: `copilot.chat` (use the chat),
`copilot.history.read` (view history), `copilot.configure`
(provider/model/budget).
