"""medical_reference — clinic-managed lookup lists for allergies,
medications, systemic diseases, and surgeries, plus the APCI flag on
diseases and active per-patient interaction/contraindication flagging.

``depends: ["patients_clinical"]`` — the one deliberate exception to this
module otherwise not reading patient data: get_patient_flags() reads a
patient's recorded Medication/SystemicDisease rows (by reference_id only)
to cross-check them against known interaction/contraindication pairs.
patients_clinical itself still links back here only loosely (a plain
nullable UUID, no DB-level FK), so it keeps working standalone if this
module is ever removed — the dependency only goes one direction.
