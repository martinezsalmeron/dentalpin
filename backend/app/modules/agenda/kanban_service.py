"""KanbanDayService — per-day operational snapshot for the kanban board.

Produces the payload consumed by the professionals strip:

    {
      date, clinic_id,
      professionals: [{
        id, first_name, last_name,
        state: "free" | "in_treatment" | "on_break" | "off",
        current_appointment_id?: UUID,
        current_cabinet_id?: UUID
      }]
    }

Module-isolation rules: ``schedules`` is optional at runtime. If it's
installed we consult its availability service to distinguish ``on_break``
and ``off`` from plain ``free`` / ``in_treatment``. If it isn't, every
professional outside of an active treatment is simply ``free`` — the
module keeps working without the extra nuance.
