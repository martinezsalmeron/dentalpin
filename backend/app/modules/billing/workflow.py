        # Credit Note (Rectificativa) Special Logic
        # =======================================================================
        #
        # When issuing a credit note, the following applies:
        #
        # 1. ORIGINAL INVOICE: Does NOT change status.
        #    - Both invoices are valid fiscal documents that coexist.
        #    - The patient's balance is calculated by summing all invoices.
        #    - This is the standard behavior in most countries (Spain, EU, USA, UK).
        #
        # 2. CREDIT NOTE: Stays in "issued" status with NEGATIVE balance.
        #    - total: negative amount (e.g., -100.00)
        #    - total_paid: 0.00 (nothing has been paid yet)
        #    - balance_due: negative (e.g., -100.00) = credit in patient's favor
        #
        # 3. BALANCE CALCULATION:
        #    - Patient balance = sum of all invoice balance_due values
        #    - Positive = patient owes money
        #    - Negative = clinic owes patient (refund or credit for future)
        #
        # 4. COUNTRY-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR:
        #    - Some countries (e.g., Mexico, Argentina) may require cancelling
        #      the original invoice. This should be handled by the compliance
        #      hook (on_credit_note_issued) which receives both invoices and
        #      can modify the original invoice's status if required.

        """Create a credit note (rectificativa) for an invoice in draft status.

        The credit note is created in draft status so it can be reviewed and
        edited before being issued via issue_invoice().

        IMPORTANT - Fiscal treatment:
            - The original invoice does NOT change status when the credit note
              is issued. Both documents are valid and coexist.
            - The patient's balance is calculated by summing all invoices
              (original + credit notes). A negative balance means the clinic
              owes the patient (refund or credit for future invoices).
            - This is the standard behavior in most countries (Spain, EU, UK, USA).
            - For countries that require cancelling the original invoice
              (e.g., Mexico, Argentina), use the on_credit_note_issued hook.

        Args:
            db: Database session
            original_invoice: Invoice to rectify
            created_by: User creating the credit note

            items: Optional list of items to rectify (partial credit note).
                   If None, rectifies the entire invoice amount.
