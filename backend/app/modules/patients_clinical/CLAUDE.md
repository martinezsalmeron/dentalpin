# Patients clinical module

Normalized medical history, allergies, medications, emergency contacts.
Separate from `patients` because the data is sensitive and should be
gated by clinical roles.

## Public API

Routes mounted at `/api/v1/patients-clinical/`.

## Dependencies

`manifest.depends = ["patients"]`.

## Permissions

`patients_clinical.medical.{read,write}`,
`patients_clinical.emergency.{read,write}`.

## Events emitted

- `patient.medical_updated` — consumed by `patient_timeline`.

## Events consumed

None.

## Lifecycle

- `removable=False`. Clinical decisions reference this data.

## Gotchas

- **Hygienists do NOT have write access** to medical history.
  Receptionists read only emergency contacts (in some clinic
  configurations not even that — check role policy).
- **Allergies and medications drive UI alerts.** Schema changes here
  affect the patient header banner — coordinate frontend.
- **Audit every write.** This is the most sensitive surface in the
  product after billing.
