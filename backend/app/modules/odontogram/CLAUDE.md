# Odontogram module

Dental charting: tooth state, surfaces, conditions, clinical
treatments per tooth.

## Public API

Routes mounted at `/api/v1/odontogram/`.

## Dependencies

`manifest.depends = ["patients", "catalog"]`.

## Permissions

`odontogram.read`, `odontogram.write`,
`odontogram.treatments.read`, `odontogram.treatments.write`.

## Events emitted

- `odontogram.treatment.added`
- `odontogram.treatment.status_changed`
- `odontogram.treatment.performed`
- `odontogram.treatment.deleted`

(Surface/tooth update events `odontogram.surface.updated`,
`odontogram.tooth.updated`, `odontogram.condition.changed` are declared
in `EventType` but not yet emitted by code — TODO.)

## Events consumed

None.

## Lifecycle

- `removable=False`. Treatment_plan, budget depend on tooth treatments.

## Gotchas

- **FDI numbering is strict** (11–48 permanent, 51–85 deciduous).
  Validate at the boundary; don't trust caller-supplied tooth ids.
- **Treatments fired on `performed`** are the trigger for budget +
  treatment_plan sync. Idempotency matters — a re-fire must not
  double-charge.
- **Surface state lives in JSONB** (`constants.py` defines the keys).
  Migrations that change the shape must include data migrations.
