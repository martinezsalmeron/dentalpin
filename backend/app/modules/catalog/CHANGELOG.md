# Changelog — catalog module

## Unreleased

- fix(isolation): drop the cross-module imports of
  ``billing.InvoiceItem`` and ``budget.BudgetItem`` from
  ``CatalogService.get_popular_items``. Catalog is foundational
  (``manifest.depends = []``) — importing consumer-module models
  inverted the DAG and blocked uninstall of billing / budget. The
  usage ranking now reads the sibling tables through a single raw
  ``UNION ALL`` SQL fragment and falls back to the most recent
  active items when a clinic has no budgets / invoices yet.
- Added per-module `CLAUDE.md` for AI-agent context (2026-04-27).

## 0.1.0 — initial

- Treatment catalog with categories.
- VAT types with versioning.
- Pricing rules in `pricing.py`.
- Idempotent seed in `seed.py`.
