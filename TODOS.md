# TODOS — DentalPin

> The open standard for dental clinic management.

---

## 1. VISION AND PRINCIPLES

### What is DentalPin

DentalPin is open source dental clinic management software designed to be:

- **Modular** — Every feature is a self-contained module
- **API-First** — Everything is accessible via REST API
- **Multi-tenant** — Built for clinic isolation from day one
- **Extensible** — Third parties can build integrations and modules

### License: BSL 1.1

- **Free to use** for clinics (self-hosted or cloud)
- **Contributions** welcome and encouraged
- **Prohibited** to host as a competing commercial SaaS
- **Converts to Apache 2.0** after 4 years

#### Complete Patient Record 🔴 P0

The current patient record is basic. Implementation divided into 4 phases:

---

##### Phase 1: Core Patient Data + Medical History + Alerts ✅

Extended `clinical` module with:

- Emergency contact with legal guardian support
- Medical history JSONB (allergies, medications, systemic diseases, surgical history, special conditions)
- Patient alerts computed from medical history
- Patient timeline populated via event handlers
- Sidebar + tabs UI layout with quick info and alerts banner

---

##### Phase 2: Documents + File Storage ⚠️ Partial

**Scope:** New `media` module with storage abstraction. Patient documents functionality.

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Separate `media` module (reusable for images, X-rays, attachments)

---

### AI Infrastructure 🔴 P0

Tracked in issue #42. Phase 1 landed the core contract; Phase 2/3 extend the system with UX, a reference agent, and scheduling.

**Phase 1 — Core Contract ✅ (shipped)**

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `ToolRegistry` | ✅ | Namespaced registry, JSON Schema helper, single-chokepoint `call()` |
| `BaseAgent` + `AgentContext` | ✅ | Abstract base, mode enum, execution context |
| `BaseModule.get_tools()` | ✅ | Mandatory abstract on every module (all 13 stubbed) |
| `BaseModule.get_agents()` | ✅ | Default `[]`, override to register agent classes |
| Guardrails | ✅ | Rate limits, blocked tools, require-approval patterns, auto-approval for DESTRUCTIVE / supervised-WRITE |
| Audit log | ✅ | `agent_audit_logs` table, every tool attempt recorded |
| Approval queue (backend) | ✅ | `agent_approval_queue` + service + endpoints |
| `agents.*` RBAC | ✅ | `agents.view/supervise/configure/manage` permissions |
| Docs | ✅ | `docs/creating-modules.md` §12 "AI agent integration" |

**Phase 2 — UX + First Agent 🟠 P1**

- [ ] **Frontend approval UI** — `/approvals` page, pending-count badge in navbar, approve/reject modal with notes field. Use `ListRow` + `StatusBadge`.
- [ ] **Reference Appointment Reminder Agent** — standalone module at `backend/app/modules/agents/reminder/`. Add `anthropic` SDK to `backend/requirements.txt`. Demonstrates tool discovery, multi-turn tool loop, audit trail.
- [ ] **Cron / scheduling trigger** — APScheduler in-process or external cron hitting `POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/run`. Decide when building the reminder agent.
- [ ] **Per-module tool retrofit** — wrap existing service methods as Tools, module by module, as real agents need them. Start with `agenda` (appointments) + `patients` (search) since the reminder agent needs them.

**Phase 3 — Hardening 🟡 P2**

- [ ] Per-clinic guardrail configuration UI (admin) — edit rate limits, blocked patterns, require-approval patterns from settings
- [ ] `AgentMemory` production backends — Redis for short-term session memory, Postgres for long-term
- [ ] LLM abstraction layer — optional, only if a second provider appears or cost tracking needs a central chokepoint
- [ ] Distributed rate-limit store — replace in-process counters once DentalPin runs with multiple backend workers
- [ ] Token / cost metering per clinic — billing dashboard

**Non-goals (deferred indefinitely)**

- LLM provider abstraction in core — each agent imports its own SDK
- Multi-agent coordination — agents communicate via the existing event bus, not a custom protocol
- Vector DB / RAG primitives — add only when a concrete agent requires them

## 11. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is DentalPin

Open source dental clinic management software:
- **Free core** generates adoption and ecosystem
- **Modular architecture** enables third-party integrations
- **BSL 1.1 license** protects against SaaS competitors while allowing free use

### Why it exists

1. The dental software market is fragmented and legacy
2. Clinics deserve modern, open, affordable software
3. An open standard benefits the entire industry

### What to build first

1. 🔴 **Complete patient record** — Without this, no MVP
2. ✅ **Catalog** — Treatment catalog implemented
3. 🔴 **Budgets + Billing** — The revenue workflow (depends on catalog ✅)
4. 🟠 **Verifactu** — Mandatory legal compliance
5. 🟠 **Inventory** — Stock and supplies management

### How we measure success

**Primary metric:** Active clinics using DentalPin daily.

Everything else (stars, contributors, modules) are supporting indicators.
