DentalPin is open source dental clinic management software designed to be:

- **Modular** — Every feature is a self-contained module
- **API-First** — Everything is accessible via REST API
- **Multi-tenant** — Built for clinic isolation from day one
- **Extensible** — Third parties can build integrations and modules

### License: BSL 1.1

- **Free to use** for clinics (self-hosted or cloud)
- **Contributions** welcome and encouraged
- **Prohibited** to host as a competing commercial SaaS
- **Converts to Apache 2.0** after 4 years

## 11. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is DentalPin

Open source dental clinic management software:
- **Free core** generates adoption and ecosystem
- **Modular architecture** enables third-party integrations
- **BSL 1.1 license** protects against SaaS competitors while allowing free use

### Why it exists

1. The dental software market is fragmented and legacy
2. Clinics deserve modern, open, affordable software
3. An open standard benefits the entire industry

### What to build first

1. 🔴 **Complete patient record** — Without this, no MVP
2. ✅ **Catalog** — Treatment catalog implemented
3. 🔴 **Budgets + Billing** — The revenue workflow (depends on catalog ✅)
4. 🟠 **Verifactu** — Mandatory legal compliance
5. 🟠 **Inventory** — Stock and supplies management

### How we measure success

**Primary metric:** Active clinics using DentalPin daily.

Everything else (stars, contributors, modules) are supporting indicators.
